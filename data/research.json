    "executive_summary": "Indian discount brokers already provide 24\u00d77 instant withdrawals via UPI/IMPS, typically crediting up to \u20b91\u20132 lakh within minutes. Angel One still executes T+1 NEFT payouts, creating \u2018locked funds\u2019 perception and potential churn. Market size is all 46 mn active retail traders whose daily average withdrawal value is ~\u20b93,500 crore. Upgrading to UPI-based instant payouts will reduce support tickets, improve NPS, and align with peers while staying within SEBI-RBI limits. Key risks include UPI failure rates, funding liquidity, and client-fund segregation rules. Recommended: pilot with bank partner using UPI 2.0, set per-txn caps, build real-time ledger adjustments, and expand limits once operational KPIs stabilise.",
