    "executive_summary": "Risk-scored recommendation baskets can tap India\u2019s fast-growing robo-advisory TAM (USD 14 bn AUM by 2025). Competitors like smallcase, Upstox Smartlists and Zerodha use simplified risk tags but lack dynamic multi-asset scoring. Building a SEBI-compliant risk-profiling engine and basket scorer, with <200 ms advice latency, positions Angel One to upsell advisory and retain users. Key risks are model drift, data privacy (DPDP Act 2023) and suitability breaches. Short-term focus: license alignment, data capture, MVP scorer; long-term: multi-asset optimisation and generative-AI explanations.",

Robo-advisory AUM expected to hit USD 14 bn by 2025 (Livemint). Wealth-tech revenue pool forecast at USD 135-150 bn by 2030 (BCG). Theme-based basket products (smallcase, Smartlists) have seen 4-5\u00d7 user growth since 2020, indicating adoption of curated portfolios.
