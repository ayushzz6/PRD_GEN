Analyse the different kinds of sensitive data shown to the Customer on the frontend application to ensure that only what is deemed absolutely necessary is transmitted and displayed. 2. Wherever possible, mask portions of sensitive data. For instance, rather than displaying the full phone number or a bank account number, display only a portion of it, enough for the Customer to identify, but useless to an unscrupulous party who may obtain covertly obtain it from the Customer s screen. For instance, if a bank account number is 123 456 789 , consider displaying something akin to XXX XXX 789 instead of the whole number. This also has the added benefit of not having to transmit the full piece of data over various networks. 3. Analyse data and databases holistically and draw out meaningful and silos (physical or virtual) into which different kinds of data can be isolated and cordoned off. For instance, a database with personal financial information need not be a part of the system or network that houses the public facing websites of the Stock Broker. They should ideally be in discrete silos or DMZs. 4. Implement strict data access controls amongst personnel, irrespective of their responsibilities, technical or otherwise.

Take measures to ensure that the confidentiality of data is not compromised under any of these scenarios. 177 5. Use industry standard, strong encryption algorithms (eg: RSA, AES etc.) wherever encryption is implemented. It is important to identify data that warrants encryption as encrypting all data is infeasible and may open up additional attack vectors. In addition, it is critical to identify the right personnel to be in charge of, and the right methodologies for storing the encryption keys, as any compromise to either will render the encryption useless. 6. Ensure that all critical and sensitive data is adequately backed up, and that the backup locations are adequately secured. For instance, on servers on isolated networks that have no public access endpoints, or on- premise servers or disk drives that are off-limits to unauthorized personnel. Without up-to-date backups, a meaningful recovery from a disaster or cyber-attack scenario becomes increasingly difficult.

While cloud computing offers multiple advantages viz. ready to scale, ease of deployment, no overhead of maintaining physical infrastructure etc., the RE should also be aware of the new cyber security risks and challenges which cloud computing introduces. In view of the above, this cloud framework has been drafted to provide baseline standards of security and for the legal and regulatory compliances by the RE. The framework shall be seen as an addition to already existing SEBI circulars /guidelines /advisories. 65.2. Objective: The major purpose of this framework is to highlight the key risks, and mandatory control measures which REs need to put in place before 82 Reference: Circular SEBI/HO/ITD/ITD_VAPT/P/CIR/2023/033 dated March 06, 2023. 188 adopting cloud computing.

As per NIST, cloud computing has four types of deployment models viz public cloud, community cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud- a. This cloud framework is applicable for adoption of public cloud and community cloud. Consequently, REs are permitted to deploy public cloud and community cloud models, subject to the conditions specified herein. b. A private cloud shall be considered as an on-premise deployment model and consequently, private cloud deployments shall be governed by SEBI circulars (for example cybersecurity circular, outsourcing circular, BCP- DR, etc.), guidelines, advisories, etc. issued from time to time. Therefore, private cloud deployments (by REs) are permitted, however, such deployments may not be governed by this cloud framework. c. A hybrid cloud is a combination of two or more out of public cloud, community cloud and private cloud. Therefore, this cloud framework as well as the"

However, as the field of cloud computing is a dynamic and emerging area, SEBI may allow deployment of other models after due consultations. The same may be specified by SEBI from time to time. 65.6. Approach: The cloud framework is a principle-based framework which covers 190 Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC), selection of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), data ownership and data localization, due- diligence by REs, security controls, legal and regulatory obligations, DR & BCP, and vendor lock-in risk.

Generally, higher the volatility of a security/derivatives contract, greater is its price swings. There may be normally greater volatility in thinly traded securities / derivatives contracts than in active securities /derivatives contracts. As a result of volatility, your order may only be partially executed or not executed at all, or the price at which your order got executed may be substantially different from the last traded price or change substantially thereafter, resulting in notional or real losses. 1.2 Risk of Lower Liquidity: Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and/or sell securities / derivatives contracts expeditiously at a competitive price and with minimal price difference. Generally, it is assumed that more the numbers of orders available in a market, greater is the liquidity. Liquidity is important because with greater liquidity, it is easier for investors to buy and/or sell securities / derivatives contracts swiftly and with minimal price difference, and as a result, investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities / derivatives contracts purchased or sold. There may be a risk of lower liquidity in some securities / derivatives contracts as compared to active securities / derivatives contracts. As a result, your"

As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or may be executed with relatively greater price difference or may not be executed at all. 1.2.1 Buying or selling securities / derivatives contracts as part of a day trading strategy may also result into losses, because in such a situation, securities / derivatives contracts may have to be sold / purchased at low / high prices, compared to the expected price levels, so as not to have any open position or obligation to deliver or receive a security / derivatives contract. 1.3 Risk of Wider Spreads: Spread refers to the difference in best buy price and best sell price. It represents the differential between the price of buying a security / derivatives contract and immediately selling it or vice versa. Lower liquidity and higher volatility may result in wider than normal spreads for less liquid or illiquid securities / derivatives contracts. This in turn will hamper better price formation. 289 1.4 Risk-reducing orders: The placing of orders (e.g., \"stop loss orders, or \"limit\" orders) which are intended to limit losses to certain amounts may not be effective many a time because rapid movement in market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. 1.4.1 A \"market\" order will be executed promptly, subject to availability of orders on opposite side, without regard to price and that, while the customer may receive a prompt execution"

However, while the customer receives price protection, there is a possibility that the order may not be executed at all. 1.4.3 A stop loss order is generally placed \"away\" from the current price of a stock / derivatives contract, and such order gets activated if and when the security / derivatives contract reaches, or trades through, the stop price. Sell stop orders are entered ordinarily below the current price, and buy stop orders are entered ordinarily above the current price. When the security / derivatives contract reaches the pre - determined price, or trades through such price, the stop loss order converts to a market/limit order and is executed at the limit or better. There is no assurance therefore that the limit order will be executable since a security / derivatives contract might penetrate the pre-determined price, in which case, the risk of such order not getting executed arises, just as with a regular limit order. 1.5 Risk of News Announcements: News announcements"

Thus, there exists a possibility of communication failure or system problems or slow or delayed response from system or trading halt, or any such other problem/glitch whereby not being able to establish access to the trading system/network, which may be beyond control and may result in delay in processing or not processing buy or sell orders either in part or in full. You are cautioned to note that although these problems may be temporary in nature, but when you have outstanding open positions or unexecuted orders, these represent a risk because of your obligations to settle all executed transactions. 2. As far as Derivatives segments are concerned, please note and get yourself acquainted with the following additional features:- 2.1 Effect of \"Leverage\" or \"Gearing\": In the derivatives market, the amount of margin is small relative to the value of the derivatives contract so the transactions are 'leveraged' or 'geared'. Derivatives trading, which is conducted with a relatively small amount of margin, provides the possibility of great profit or loss in comparison with the margin amount. But transactions in derivatives carry a high degree of risk. You should therefore completely understand the following statements before actually"

You should therefore completely understand the following statements before actually trading in derivatives and also trade with caution while taking into account one's circumstances, financial resources, etc. If the prices move against you, you may lose a part of or whole margin amount in a relatively short period of time. Moreover, the loss may exceed the original margin amount. A. Futures trading involve daily settlement of all positions. Every day the open positions are marked to market based on the closing level of the index / derivatives contract. If the contract has moved against you, you will be required to deposit the amount of loss (notional) resulting from such movement. This amount will have to be paid within a stipulated time frame, generally before commencement of trading on next day. 291 B. If you fail to deposit the additional amount by the deadline or if an outstanding debt occurs in your account, the stock broker may liquidate a part of or the whole position or substitute securities. In this case, you will be liable for any losses incurred due to such close-outs. C. Under certain market conditions, an investor may find it difficult or impossible to execute transactions. For example, this situation can occur due to factors such as illiquidity i.e. when there are insufficient bids or offers or suspension of trading due to price limit or circuit breakers etc. D.

These new measures may also be applied to the existing open interests. In such conditions, you will be required to put up additional margins or reduce your positions. E. You must ask your broker to provide the full details of derivatives contracts you plan to trade i.e. the contract specifications and the associated obligations. 2.2 Currency specific risks: 1. The profit or loss in transactions in foreign currency-denominated contracts, whether they are traded in your own or another jurisdiction, will be affected by fluctuations in currency rates where there is a need to convert from the currency denomination of the contract to another currency. 2. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example when a currency is deregulated or fixed trading bands are widened. 3. Currency prices are highly volatile. Price movements for currencies are influenced by, among other things: changing supply-demand relationships; trade, fiscal, monetary, exchange control programs and policies of governments; foreign political and economic events and policies; changes in national and international interest rates and inflation; currency devaluation; and sentiment of the market place.

None of these factors can be controlled by any individual advisor and no assurance can be given that an advisor's advice will result in profitable trades for a participating customer or that a customer will not incur losses from such events. 2.3 Risk of Option holders: 1. An option holder runs the risk of losing the entire amount paid for the option in a relatively short period of time. This risk reflects the nature of an option as a wasting asset which becomes worthless when it expires. An option holder who neither sells his option in the secondary market nor exercises it prior to its expiration will necessarily lose his entire investment in the option. If the price of the underlying does not change in the anticipated direction before the option expires, to an extent 292 sufficient to cover the cost of the option, the investor may lose all or a significant part of his investment in the option. 2. The Exchanges may impose exercise restrictions and have absolute authority to restrict the exercise of options at certain times in specified circumstances. 2.4 Risks of Option Writers: 1. If the price movement of the underlying is not in the anticipated direction, the option writer runs the risks of losing substantial amount. 2. The risk of being an option writer may be reduced by the purchase of other options on the same underlying interest and thereby assuming a spread position or by acquiring other types of hedging positions in the options markets or other markets."

However, even where the writer has assumed a spread or other hedging position, the risks may still be significant. A spread position is not necessarily less risky than a simple 'long' or 'short' position. 3. Transactions that involve buying and writing multiple options in combination, or buying or writing options in combination with buying or selling short the underlying interests, present additional risks to investors. Combination transactions, such as option spreads, are more complex than buying or writing a single option. And it should be further noted that, as in any area of investing, a complexity not well understood is, in itself, a risk factor. While this is not to suggest that combination strategies should not be considered, it is advisable, as is the case with all investments in options, to consult with someone who is experienced and knowledgeable with respect to the risks and potential rewards of combination transactions under various market circumstances. 3.

For mitigating the insider threat problem, 'least privilege' approach to provide security for both on-and off-premises resources (i.e., zero-trust models) should be implemented. Zero Trust is rooted in the principle of \"trust nothing, verify everything.\" This security model requires strict identity verification for each and every resource and device attempting to get access to any information on a private network, regardless of where they are situated, within or outside of a network perimeter. 8. Cybersecurity Controls: i. Deploy web and email filters on the network. Configure these devices to scan for known bad domains, sources, and addresses, block these before receiving and downloading messages. Scan all emails, attachments, and downloads both on the host and at the mail gateway with a reputable antivirus solution. ii. Block the malicious domains/IPs after"

It has been observed that single third party vendors are providing services to multiple REs, which creates concentration risk. Here, such third parties though being small non-financial organizations, if any cyber-attack, happens at such organizations, the same could have systemic implication due to high concentration risk. ii. Thus, there is a need for identification of such organizations and prescribing specific cyber security controls, including audit of their systems and protocols from independent auditors, to mitigate such concentration risk. iii. Further, REs also need to take into account this concentration risk while outsourcing multiple critical services to the same vendor. 12. Audit and ISO Certification: i.

It exists on the premises of the cloud provider 4 Hybrid Cloud The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability. 2. Cloud Service Models- A. The definitions of various cloud service models (as per NIST)116 are given below: i. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not directly manage or control the underlying cloud 116 Ref: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf 339 infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).

The consumer does not directly manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment. A few examples of PaaS are Google App Engine, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk, etc. iii. Software as a Service (SaaS): The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings. A few examples of SaaS are Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, etc. B.

For example, Security as a Service is a form of SaaS which provides specialized information security services. Similarly, Application as a Service is a type of 340 SaaS in which applications (for example Google sheets, Google docs, etc.) are delivered on-demand to customers through the internet. 3. Regulated Entity (RE) The term Regulated Entity refers to SEBI registered/ recognized intermediaries (for example brokers, mutual funds, KYC Registration Agencies, and QRTAs) and Market Infrastructure Institutions (Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations, and Depositories) regulated by SEBI. 4. Key Management- In the context of encryption/ decryption, a key is typically a random string of bits generated to hide (encrypt) or reveal (decrypt) data. A key is most commonly used along with an algorithm (method) for encryption/ decryption of data. Therefore, Key management refers to management of cryptographic keys in a system, including their (keys ) generation, exchange, storage, etc. 5. Hardware Security Module (HSM)- A Hardware Security Module is a device that is used for management of Keys, as well as for implementing various functions like encryption, decryption, authentication, etc. Principle 1: Governance, Risk and Compliance Sub-Framework 1.
